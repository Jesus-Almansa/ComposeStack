# Fullstack Application with Flask and React - Dockerized

This repository demonstrates a fullstack application with a Flask backend, React frontend, and Docker Compose orchestration. The challenge and purpose of this setup is to successfully launch and integrate all components seamlessly.

## Getting Started

To run this application, ensure that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your machine. 

### Prerequisites
1. Docker (20.x or later recommended)
2. Docker Compose (1.29 or later)

### Cloning the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

```

## Setup and Launch

### Step 1: Build and Start the Containers
From the project’s root directory, run:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This command will:
1. Build the Docker images for both the backend (Flask) and frontend (React).
2. Start the containers and link them together.

### Step 2: Access the Application
Once all services are running, you can access the application at:
- **Frontend (React):** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Backend (Flask):** `http://localhost:5000`

*Note:* Ports may vary depending on the configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Usage
- **Frontend**: The React app serves as the user interface, making requests to the backend.
- **Backend**: The Flask app processes API requests and provides the necessary responses to the frontend.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: For the backend, handling API requests.
- **React**: For the frontend, building a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: To containerize and orchestrate the multi-service setup.

## Troubleshooting

- **Containers not starting**: Ensure Docker is running on your machine, and check if any existing service is using the ports defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Real-time updates not reflecting in containers**: Use `docker-compose up --build` after making significant changes to the code to ensure everything is up to date.
- **Network errors between containers**: Run `docker network ls` and verify that Docker Compose created the appropriate network for the services.
